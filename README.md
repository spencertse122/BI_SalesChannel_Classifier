through its mutual fund products. Firm X’s sales force periodically meets with Financial Advisors at
various brokerage firms (also called intermediaries) located across the continental United States, Alaska,
Puerto Rico and Hawaii. 

## Data Description:
We are providing you with a dataset split in two files (Analytics Data 1.zip and Analytics Data 2.zip) to
use as the basis of your analysis. Combine the files before beginning your analysis.
After combining the files, you will find the following data details: (1) Broker Name [variable:
broker_name]: The intermediary firm where the fund was sold; (2) City & State [variable: city_state]:
Location of the intermediary firm’s city and state; (3) Territory [variable: territory]: Each territory is the
responsibility of a single sales person—Prefix “I” denotes the “IBD” channel and “W” denotes the
“Wirehouse” channel; (4) Fund Category [variable: fund_category]: The Morning Star category of the
fund that was sold; (5) Firm X Sales [variable: firm_x_sales]: Amount of funds sold at the specific
intermediary by Firm X; (6) Total Industry Sales [variable: total_industry_sales]: Total amount of funds
sold (including those by Firm X) at that intermediary; (7) Email Open [variable: email_open]: Whether or
not an email from Firm X has been opened by a broker; (8) Web Visit [variable: web_visit]: Whether or
not Firm X’s website has been visited by a broker; (9) Webcast Attendee [variable: webcast_attendee]:
Whether or not a webcast by Firm X has been attended by a broker; (10) Marketing Engaged [variable:

broker.

## Objective:
Your goal is broad: examine the mutual fund flows across brokerages, geographies, fund categories and
territories to provide actionable insights that will help Firm X increase its flows and elevate firm X’s
market share. You are expected to produce a 30-45 minute presentation and walk the audience through
your thought process. Following your presentation please be prepared to answer questions from the team.
